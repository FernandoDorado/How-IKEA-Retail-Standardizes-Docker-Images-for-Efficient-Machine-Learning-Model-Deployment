# How-IKEA-Retail-Standardizes-Docker-Images-for-Efficient-Machine-Learning-Model-Deployment
Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to showcasing IKEA Retail's best practices for managing Docker images, optimized for efficient machine learning model deployment. This repository is a complementary resource for the Docker Blog post titled [How IKEA Retail Standardizes Docker Images for Efficient Machine Learning Model Deployment"](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-ikea-retail-standardizes-docker-images-for-efficient-machine-learning-model-deployment/)

## Pre-requisites

Before diving into the contents of this repository and replicating the procedures, ensure you have the following set up:

* Python: A local installation of Python 3.7 or newer. Verify the installation with the command python --version.

* Docker: A local installation of Docker Desktop. This facilitates containerization of applications. If you're using cloud platforms or non-desktop environments, ensure you have docker-daemon or its equivalent installed as offered by the respective cloud vendors. Confirm your Docker installation with docker --version.

* Dependencies: Install all the required Python libraries and dependencies as listed in requirements.txt. You can quickly install them using:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Ensure all the above pre-requisites are in place for a seamless experience with the repository's content.


## Repository Structure and Files
Here's a brief overview of the contents of this repository:

1. DEMO.ipynb: A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that walks you through each step discussed in the blog post. It's highly recommended to start here as it provides a hands-on demonstration of the entire process.

2. DockerModel.py: The Python script containing the definition of the DockerModel class, showcasing how machine learning models are structured for deployment using Docker.


3. Dockerfile : The architectural blueprint for building Docker images. This file outlines the instructions for creating a Docker image, ensuring a coherent, isolated environment.

4. requirements.txt: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required to run the model encapsulated in the Docker image.

5. data/: Directory containing datasets or sample data used in the machine learning process.

6. models/: Directory housing pre-trained machine learning models or model artifacts.

## Getting Started

Begin by checking out the DEMO.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. This notebook offers a comprehensive demonstration of the machine learning model deployment process using Docker, as discussed in the blog post.

Familiarize yourself with the Python code in DockerModel.py and the configuration set out in the Dockerfile.
Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed, as listed in requirements.txt.

## Important Considerations

While the repository provides all the necessary resources to understand the Docker-based ML deployment process adopted by IKEA Retail, it's essential to refer back to the original blog post for a detailed explanation and context behind each step.
